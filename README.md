# Toatie

> A spicy hardware description language with dependent types

We poke, bend, and otherwise abuse Tiny Idris --- introduced by [Edwin
Brady](https://github.com/edwinb) at [SPLV20](https://github.com/edwinb/SPLV20).
Our main additions to support hardware description include erasure/irrelevance of
non-synthesisable terms, staging for circuit generators, deriving bit
representations, and the synthesis itself.

This is a toy language, and a work in progress toy at that ðŸ¤·

## Usage

### Building

Everything is packed up as a nix flake. If you've got the [nix package
manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#chap-installation), you can
rebuild the compiler with:

```console
me@computer:~/toatie $ nix build .
```

This builds the `toatie` executable found in `result/bin/` and runs all of our
tests. Example source files can be found in the `libs/Examples` and `Test`
directories.

### Development

We can also use the nix flake to recreate our development environment. It'll
pull in a compatible version of Idris2, its emacs mode, and expose a few handy
aliases for `toatie` development.

```console
me@computer:~/toatie $ nix develop

me@computer:~/toatie $ devEmacs #Open an emacs session with Idris2 support
me@computer:~/toatie $ devBuild #Build toatie in build/exec/
me@computer:~/toatie $ devTest  #Run all tests in Test/{good,bad}
me@computer:~/toatie $ devRepl Test/Unsigned.tt #Start the toatie REPL
```

## Examples

Let's look at an unsigned adder example. The entire _family_ of unsigned adder
circuits is described as a function `addU` in `Data.Unsigned`. We can specialise
that into a synthesisable circuit by supplying a concrete wordlength and
returning a closed, quoted circuit term:

```
import Data.Nat
import Data.Unsigned

-- Top-level adder specialised for 5-bit inputs
adder : {x,y : Nat} ->
        < Unsigned 5 x -> Unsigned 5 y ->
          Unsigned 6 ((plus x y))
        >
pat x, y =>
  adder {x} {y}
    = [| \xs : Unsigned _ _ =>
         \ys : Unsigned _ _ =>
         ~(addU _ {_} {_} {_} [|xs|] [|ys|] [| O |])
      |]
```

Note the `<...>`, `[|...|]`, and `~` terms for quoted types, quoted terms, and
escaping quotes respectively. The wordlengths and natural number encodings of
each `Unsigned` argument can be inferred during typechecking, so are left
implicit (with `_`). The circuit's type guarantees that the output will:

  1. encode the sum of of inputs' natural number encodings
  2. extend the wordlength by 1

These properties are proven in the implementation of `addU`. You can try loading
it in the REPL and use the `:Netlist adder` command to print its VHDL
representation. See this example (with testbench and synthesised netlist svg) in
`Test/good_synth/adder/` after running the test suite with `devTest`.

## Progress

We'll work towards:

  - [X] Simple let bindings
  - [X] Inline case statements (no "with" views though)
  - [X] Coverage checking and impossible clauses
  - [X] Unification similar to Idris2
  - [X] Example proofs good enough to verify binary addition
  - [X] Multi-stage core TT (See paper "A Verified Staged Interpreter is a
        Verified Compiler"; let's us unroll recursive defs of circuits in our
        source language rather than the compiler)
  - [X] Irrelevance/erasure with ICC* (See Barras' paper "The Implicit Calculus
        of Constructions as a Programming Language with Dependent Types")
  - [X] Different case tree behaviour --- implicit and quoted patterns are inaccessible
  - [X] A very simple module system (only one namespace)
  - [X] Separating type constructors into `Parameter` types (value known at compile-time) and `Simple`
        types (value known only at circuit run-time; derivable bit width)
  - [X] Checking GADTs over `Simple` types for decidable sizes
  - [X] Deriving bit representations for GADTs over `Simple` types
  - [X] Conversion of Terms to something like Clash's ANF
  - [X] Generating netlists from this ANF.
  - [ ] Encoding _synchronous_ logic
