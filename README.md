# Toatie

> A spicy Hardware Description Language with dependent types

We poke, bend, and otherwise abuse Tiny Idris --- introduced by [Edwin
Brady](https://github.com/edwinb) at [SPLV20](https://github.com/edwinb/SPLV20).
Our main additions to support hardware description include erasure/irrelevance of
non synthesisable terms, staging for circuit generators, deriving bit
representations, and the synthesis itself.

This is a toy language, and a work in progress toy at that ðŸ¤·

## Usage

### Building

Everything is packed up as a nix flake. If you've got the [nix package
manager](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#chap-installation), you can
rebuild the compiler with:

```console
me@computer:~/toatie $ nix build .
```

This builds the `toatie` executable found in `result/bin/` and runs all of our
tests. Example source files can be found in the `Test` directory.

### Development

We can also use the nix flake to recreate our development environment. It'll
pull in a compatible version of Idris2, its emacs mode, and expose a few handy
aliases for `toatie` development.

```console
me@computer:~/toatie $ nix develop

me@computer:~/toatie $ devEmacs #Open an emacs session with Idris2 support
me@computer:~/toatie $ devBuild #Build toatie in build/exec/
me@computer:~/toatie $ devTest  #Run all tests in Test/{good,bad}
me@computer:~/toatie $ devRepl Test/Unsigned.tt #Start the toatie REPL
```

## Examples

TODO

## Progress

We'll work towards:

  - [X] Simple let bindings
  - [X] Inline case statements (no "with" views though)
  - [X] Coverage checking and impossible clauses
  - [X] Unification similar to Idris2
  - [X] Example proofs good enough to verify binary addition
  - [X] Multi-stage core TT (See paper "A Verified Staged Interpreter is a
        Verified Compiler"; let's us unroll recursive defs of circuits in our
        source language rather than the compiler)
  - [X] Irrelevance/erasure with ICC* (See Barras' paper "The Implicit Calculus
        of Constructions as a Programming Language with Dependent Types")
  - [X] Different case tree behaviour --- implicit and quoted patterns are inaccessible
  - [X] A very simple module system (only one namespace)
  - [X] Separating type constructors into `Parameter` types (value known at compile-time) and `Simple`
        types (value known only at circuit run-time; derivable bit width)
  - [X] Checking GADTs over `Simple` types for decidable sizes
  - [X] Deriving bit representations for GADTs over `Simple` types
  - [X] Conversion of Terms to something like Clash's ANF
  - [X] Generating netlists from this ANF.
  - [ ] Encoding _synchronous_ logic
